# Introduction on Parchment Seeker

The purpose of Parchment Seeker is to offer a massive search for administrative panels in web systems and websites.

## Getting to starting

```
git clone https://github.com/pedromakaveli/Parchment-Seeker.git
```

## Main features

- Parchment Seeker accepts infinite hosts and will work normally.

- Parchment Seeker accepts a personal dork list. **(But if you don't have a list of your choice, Parchment Seeker already offers a wide list of possible administrative panels included natively).**

- Parchment Seeker tests several possible extensions accompanied by the dorks used. Example: admin.php, admin.html, admin.asp.

## Note if you want to pass multiple hosts as targets

- Parchment Seeker will save the addresses where it was successful in finding the admin panel. The output will be in a .txt file in the same directory as the script (Not yet implemented).

# Warning

Parchment Seeker is a great tool to use in penetration testing. However, use it wisely and responsibly and only on testing environments or hosts that you have been allowed to use.
